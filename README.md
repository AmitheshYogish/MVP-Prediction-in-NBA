# MVP-Prediction-in-NBA

##Overview
This project seeks to use machine learning algorithms, trained on data from past NBA seasons, to predict the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the 2023 season.

The MVP award in the NBA is a prestigious honour given to the player considered the most valuable to their team during the regular season. This project leverages machine learning techniques, including XGBoost and Random Forest algorithms, to forecast the NBA MVP for the 2023 season by analyzing historical player performance data.
